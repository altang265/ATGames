**Game Loop**

	- If player rolls a double they get to roll again
	- On the third double, they are sent to jail right away
- Purchasing property
- Landing on a property
	- If UNOWNED, player is allowed to purchase the property for 
	 the listed Price
	- If UNOWNED & player does not want to purchase, the property is
	 up for auction
	- If owned, the player that lands on it pays the rent amount
	 listed on the card
	- If owned but mortgaged, the player does not have to pay the owner
- Passing go or landing on GO will award that player $200

		- Follow the instructions and place the card at the bottom of the pile

			is mutually agreed upon
	- Landing on a property 
	- Landing on income Tax

		- Paying 10% of total worth 
		- **This decision must be made before calculating total worth**
	- jail
		- Do not pass GO
		- You can still buy and sell property when you are in jail
		- A player may leave when:
			- Throw a double in the next three turns
				- On a successful throw, the player gets to move that amount

		- Must have complete color set
		- You must build evenly
			- You may buy and erect at any time 
			 as many houses as your judgement and financial standing will 
			 allow. But you must build evenly, i.e., you cannot erect more 
			 than one house on any one property of any color-group until 
			 you have built one house on every property of that group. You
			 may then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to 
			 a limit of four houses to a property.
	- Purchasing Hotels

		 back to the bank (See selling property section))

		 10% interest.

		 the player is allowed to buy housing 
		- A player is allowed to sell mortgaged property to another player
		 at a mutually agreed upon price.
		 	- At time of sale, the buyer may lift the mortgage or choose to 
			 lift it in the future but you must pay the bank 10% interest. 
			 (You will still need to pay the 10% interest later if you wish
			  to lift the mortgage)
